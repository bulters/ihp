# About IHP

IHP is a modern batteries-included Web Framework, built on top of Haskell and Nix.

We believe that functional programing is the future of software development and want to make functional programing with haskell and nix available to anyone. We try to offer a solution which can be used by developers who have not worked with haskell yet. IHP comes with everything you need to build great web applications with haskell and nix. We have made a lot of pragmatic decision to get you started faster. This way you can just pick up haskell along the way :-)

IHP stands for Integrated Haskell Platform.


## What makes it different?

**Type-safe and reliable:**
With Haskell and Nix we use the most reliable technologies available, to make sure your application will never crash because of Null Pointer Exceptions.

If you like TypeScript, you will love IHP.

**Fast dev enviroment and Live Reload:**
While haskell is a compiled language, the built-in dev server automatically reloads your code changes using the fastest way possible. Changes are reflected instantly. Just like good old PHP.

**Accessible:**
Setup of the fully-managed dev environment takes just 5 minutes. All dependencies (even database and compiler) are managed using the nix package manager. This means dependency problems just cannot occur anymore. Also everything is guaranteed to be same for all developers in your team.

**No Haskell Experience required:**
Code Generators will help you to quickly build things even when you have no professional haskell experience yet. Pick up haskell by building real world applications.

**Integrated Dev Tooling:**
To speed up your development process, IHP comes with a full set of web based dev tools. Including: a database schema designer, a web-based code generator, a web-based repl, ...

**Major Operating Systems Supported:**
Windows (via Linux Subsystem), macOS, NixOS, Debian, Ubuntu

**HSX:**
Like React's JSX. Write html code in your haskell files. This will be transformed to actual type-checked haskell code at compile time.

**Auto Refresh:**
Re-render views in the background when the underlying data changes. This is useful when you want your views to always reflect the live database state. Auto Refresh can be an easy replacement for manually polling for changes using AJAX.

**Longterm Roadmap**
Lot's of frameworks are already gone a year after launch. Especially in the fast moving JS world. But don't worry about IHP. We have been using it at digitally induced since 2017. It's actively used by us and our friends and partners. Even without external contributors we will build new features and do periodic maintenance releases in the future. We have big plans for IHP and as a profitable and independent software company we have the ability to actually execute them over the longterm.
